# 2. Restraints
High Cost: Although technology has evolved, thermal imaging systems are still expensive to manufacture. This would serve as a barrier for small organizations or industries with a small budget. The sensors, specialized optics, and image-processing technologies are very costly, making the devices out of reach to all potential users.
Technical Limitations: Thermal imaging, like any technology, comes with limits. For instance, one cannot view inside walls or through glass, and extreme weather could prove to be a challenge. Therefore, the application of the technology is limited to specific environments.
Alternative Technologies Competition: Competing technologies like night vision, or other image techniques sometimes serve as an alternative option in the marketplaces. Sometimes they might be cheaper, better fit for certain applications or purchase-at-low cost.
3. Opportunities
Automotive Sector Growth: With the current importance of advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) and autonomous vehicles, this automotive sector will provide large opportunities for thermal imaging electronics as these find more and more applications in vehicles related to pedestrian detection and collision avoidance besides other features for safety.
Consumer Electronics: Thermal imaging opens an entirely new playing field in smartphones and personal gadgets. As companies like Apple and Samsung experiment with infrared capabilities in their devices, market trends are bound to change and advance with thermal imaging incorporated into consumer electronics.
Emerging Markets: With greater accessibility and affordability of the technology, there are tremendous growth opportunities in emerging markets. Countries in Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America have burgeoning industrialization and a rising security risk, which translate to untapped opportunities.
